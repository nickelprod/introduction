# Introduction
Nickel Productions is just a couple of friends (named Nick and Kyle; clever, right?) trying to make projects together. Nick likes to write stories, and Kyle likes to write code. Not much has come of this partnership yet, but who knows what the future holds?

# Projects
Declination: a simple text adventure in a crashing space train. The plan is to add more content and convert the project to Ruby.
